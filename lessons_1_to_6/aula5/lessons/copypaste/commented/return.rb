=begin "If we donâ€™t do anything else, then a method will return the value that was returned from 
the last evaluated statement. Most often, this is the last line in the method body."
This is a case of Implicit Return, that returns the last statement in the method scope; in Ruby, 
every method returns a single object, even if it is a 'nil' object;
I'll see Explicit Return later.
