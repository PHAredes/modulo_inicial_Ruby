# Ruby Course

status: in progress (lesson 8 done)

This is a repository which i put some commented codes from the [Ruby course]((https://onebitcode.com/course/ruby-puro/)) 
available at [One Bite Code](https://onebitcode.com/course-status/) to a matter of later comparison and as a material for me to consult.

There is also some challenges done in the diretories named 'challenge', so you can see how 
i've done them and how i think of programming in pure Ruby rn.
